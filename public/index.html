      <h1>About the server</h1>
      <p>
        Alvecraft is a survival server that offers ranks and extra /sethomes for voting, grief protection, custom player shops and friendly staff!

        We preserve your survival experience, and do not allow raiding or griefing, which means all your builds are completely safe. If you like pure survival, this is the server for you!
        
        Each vote gets you closer to the next rank up, and each new rank gets you an extra /sethome.
        
        Use the wild warp waterfall at spawn to get far away and start your game! It sends you somewhere within a 20,000 block radius of spawn.
        
        The world border is 100,000 blocks so there are plenty of unexplored biomes to discover and build in!
        
        Also make sure to visit our player shops, where you can try your hand at making your own fortune by trading with other players.
